            Belgrade, the vibrant capital of Serbia, sits at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers, blending
            centuries of history with a dynamic modern spirit.
            Known for its resilient character, the city has been shaped by Roman, Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and
            Yugoslav influences, each leaving a distinct architectural
            and cultural mark. From the imposing Kalemegdan Fortress overlooking the riverbanks to the bohemian charm of
            Skadarlija street, Belgrade offers a rich tapestry
            of experiences. Its nightlife is legendary, with floating clubs on the rivers and buzzing cafés that never
            seem to sleep. Despite its tumultuous past, Belgrade
            pulses with creativity, warmth, and an unmistakable energy that captivates visitors and locals alike.

                    <h3>St Sava Temple</h3>
                    <p>
                        Located on the Vračar plateau, the temple honors Saint Sava, the founder of the Serbian Orthodox
                        Church, whose remains were believed to have been burned on this site by Ottoman authorities in
                        1595. Construction began in 1935 and continued for decades, with the church finally consecrated in
                        2004. Designed in the Neo-Byzantine style, it features a massive dome, intricate mosaics, and a capacity of
                        over 7,000 worshippers.

                    <h3>Belgrade Tower</h3>
                    <p>
                        Belgrade Tower (Kula Belgrade) is the architectural centerpiece of the Belgrade Waterfront
                        development and currently the tallest building in Serbia and the Balkans. Rising to a height of
                        168 meters (551 feet) with 40 floors, the tower is a striking symbol of modern Belgrade’s
                        transformation and ambition.

                    <h3>Kalemegdan</h3>
                    <p>
                        Kalemegdan is Belgrade’s most iconic historic site, blending ancient fortifications with serene
                        parkland at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers.
                        Originally established as the Roman settlement Singidunum, Kalemegdan evolved into a strategic
                        fortress that witnessed centuries of conflict and rule under Byzantine, Serbian, Ottoman, and
                        Austro-Hungarian empires. The Belgrade Fortress, its centerpiece, dates back to 279 BC and has
                        been rebuilt multiple times, most notably by Emperor Justinian I and Serbian despot Stefan
                        Lazarević.

                    <h3>Serbian Coffee Culture</h3>
                    <p>
                        Serbian coffee culture is a deeply rooted social tradition centered around domaća kafa—strong,
                        unfiltered coffee brewed in a džezva. More than just a drink, coffee is a reason to gather,
                        talk, and slow down. Whether at home or in a kafana, offering coffee is a gesture of
                        hospitality, and lingering over a cup is part of everyday life.
